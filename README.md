Leap Tutorial code
------------------

This is where your code for your tutorials should go. You should check in your commits on a regular basis.

RTFM

1. Start by creating your branch using git checkout
2. Make sure your work goes in the folder with your name on it 
3. Work on your branch until you finish the tutorial
4. When you are done with your tutorial, merge your changes into the master

Take advantage of reverting commits if you make a mistake
Experimient with git features, read the git book
Don't email yourself your code
